# Chronic Disease Prediction Using Graph Machine Learning

This GitHub repository hosts the codebase related to Haohui Lu's thesis, titled "Chronic Disease Prediction Using Graph Machine Learning". The work focuses on exploring advanced machine learning methodologies, specifically graph-based learning techniques, for predicting chronic diseases.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised into different folders, each corresponding to a specific chapter in the thesis. The structure ensures ease of navigation and better understanding of the content.

Each chapter's folder contains:
- `code`: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks showcasing the implementations discussed in the chapter.
- `data`: Sample data sets or links to the data sets used in the chapter (if publicly available).
- `README.md`: A brief description of the chapter's content and instructions on how to run the code.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to each chapter's folder to review the code and data.
