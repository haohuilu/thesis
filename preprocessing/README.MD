# Data Preprocessing for Chronic Disease Prediction

This repository's subdirectory is dedicated to the data preprocessing component of Haohui Lu's thesis, "Chronic Disease Prediction Using Graph Machine Learning". It contains the necessary Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) and SQL scripts for data preprocessing. We used the de-identified Commonwealth Bank Health Society (CBHS) dataset in this project.
